<h2 Introduction id="introduction" > Introduction of the Chapter </h2>

<p>The above links are repeatedly placed for you at each subchapters of this section so that you can easily browse through 
the content as it is fairly long.</p>
<p>
The following subchapters compare AutoCAD with other BIM strong software such as AutoCAD 
architecture, Revit architecture, etc. in the spirit of helping you maximize your effective usage of the software in effective
 documentation and collaboration. The subchapters discuss about current international practices and local practices and intended 
 future plans of the built environment with regards to CAD services.  This is so you can be locally aware and forward looking in your
 practice in related matters. 
</p>

 <p>
Looking in to the fact that you are a mid level engineer, the interface of the software is separately 
 placed for you in the power point presentation package (link) so that you may visit it when you may need it, however the interface content is 
 placed for you on this site and you can access it: <a href="#chapter3.2">chapter 3.2</a>. You can use te image links and explore it.      
</p>
<p>
This course recognizes the under utilization of the concept of parametric design and customization of the software through templates and 
script files (.lin, .scr, .lsp, .pat, etc.)
in AutoCAD. The course will cover the usage and customization of built in templates such as .wlt and the recent tab of the 
software parametric while demonstration and exercises. Furthermore, at this level of the course (chapter), the course discusses about usage 
of custom hatches that are not script related, attributes, data extraction for usage locally in AutoCAD and externally in excel or other software. 
</p>
<p>
On the latter chapter of the course  the professional application of the software in preparation of documents for projects of different 
scale along with the implementation of script files mentioned above (.lin, .scr, .lsp, .pat, etc.) for fundamental engagement of users in sharing 
portable files and in a manner that it is done across projects and users.

As coined by Autodesk the acronym BIM (Building Information Modeling) represents the way Revit enables 
architects, designers, and engineers to capture decisions during the design process and incorporate them 
into the overall database that represents the 3D virtual prototype of the building. This concept perhaps 
not practiced effectively and entirely not in digital format has always been the intention and attempt of 
the built environment professional.  In such regard to attain the intended qualities of BIM , the professional 
(planner, designer and engineer) needs to incorporate a very careful preparation phase before using AutoCAD software 
towards preparing documents and sharing them. AutoCAD architecture and other specialized products of Autodesk are more 
related to BIM than the standard AutoCAD software.    
</p>
<p>
Common work processes ( in CAD): 
If we take a look at the common trends projects may start with a client that already acquired a land (through lease) 
or planning to acquire one. In large scale development, it is common get public invitation bid announcements through public 
Medias, newspapers for qualified consultants to participate in the design work needed the development. This scenario may 
differ for small projects such as a single family’s residential project, etc. Once the consultant buys the bid for large 
projects or gets approached by a small scale developer, client, he or she will acquire a terms of reference with a Procurement 
Reference Number. This provides the consultant with legal right to visit the indicated project site in the terms of reference 
for the intended task.  He or she will visit the site and confirms the conditions described in the bid’s title deed map 
(site plan: boundaries, etc.) are correct. And furthermore the consultant collects further data he or she may need to
prepare the design documents needed as per the bid, for the task the consultant uses surveyors and other related 
professionals for getting geo-information’s of the location.  The terms of reference in addition to providing information 
about the project site it also passes regulations, design tasks, interest of the client, the format and type of 
digital information the client suggest for the submittals (for example architectural design drawings in .dwg format, 
report in .dox or .pdf format and presentations in panels, models and video animations). 
Below is an image of a typical title deed map consultants are presented by clients before starting to work on a project.
Mind the indication of the visual and coordinate description of the site.  

</p>

<div class="containerHover" >

      </div>
      </div>
      </div>

<p>

Therefore it is important to identify at what point the consultant needs to start digitizing exiting information 
and new once for the project at hand. Based on site information gained from the terms of reference and from the 
site visit or reconnaissance, the consultant begins to organize digital documents that will latter transform towards 
the preparation and compilation of the required documents to be submitted for the client for evaluation and further 
plans. 
The above discussion is mostly important to note that digital documentation and design process within construction 
developments has 
been made mandatory for many years, in Ethiopia for almost two decades. 
The new work processes intended (in CAD ): 
Currently there are indications that digital documentation in itself is not sufficient rather the standard (or quality) 
at which these 
documentations allow efficient work process throughout a development, hence the interest for implementation of BIM, which 
requires a central integrated three dimensional model meant to allow most if not all stakeholders involved in a development 
to collaborate, exchange interoperable data. 

This demand will have its challenges and success for various reasons. That can include: the provision of CAD and related 
software that can facilitate such work flow, the capacity of such design tools to incorporate various local work methods 
and cultures, impact on local economies and last but not least design and other professionals that might find the system 
difficult for them to shape development through their creative processes and outputs.  
However, the usual observation is that designers and other professionals long before the digital revolution have been working 
towards what these new developments are suggesting. Collaboration among different professionals was an interest of the ancient 
mater builder as the master builder coordinates different professionals towards an intended output.
In this tutorial we will see how we can use AutoCAD effectively and conduct possible work processes and documentations.  
The general summary descriptions of BIM is indicated in the figure below. Students should use the abbreviations provided under the content table of this document to understand the acronyms used in the figure and follow the discussion in the tutorial video that will be provided.

</ul>

<p>Concerning interfaces it helps if you start by thinking that most software are now generally similar in their layout. 
If you use other software such as Microsoft Word, you will be familiar with many of the interface layout of 
AutoCAD as there are many similarities. Therefore mind how much of your interface/user experience from those 
software are transferable here and avoid feeling stranger to the interface.  
In AutoCAD, you will create  and edit drawings in the model space, layout space (here more of title block elements than drawings not advised for drawings) and block editor interface. 
You will make other editing by filling out prompts in windows such as options (where you will fill your 
preferences, etc.),  text and other styles in a similar fashion.  </p>

<p>

      AutoCAD comes with pre-settings that are stored in drawing template files (.dwt). 
      The default path to templates of AutoCAD (locations of the files , .dwt,) on your computer is : 
      C + users + username + AppData + local + Autodesk + AutoCad 2021 + R240 + enu + Template. 
      You can create your own templates by modifying these provided templates. 
      You can not start AutoCAD with out using one of these templates.  
      In fact if you would start AutoCAD for the first time and if you get to the start window and 
      went on to starting a project with the default settings, it means you are using the .acad.dwt 
      template file that is commonly the default template for most versions of AutoCAD.
      However you can create  a new template and name it according to your interest.  
      

</p>




      <div class="containerHover">
            <img src="general_images/templates0.png " alt="The Golden Gate bridge drawing." class="pics" width="100%">
            <div class="middle">
            <div class="text01">
                  The figure shows Template selection from the start window; Template selection from the command:  
                  file + new and Template path modification from the options dialogue box from left to right.               
            </div>
            </div>
            </div>




<p>
You can change the default path of templates to wherever in your computer you may have saved the template you created 
so that you can find these template whenever you start your installed AutoCAD. 
To modify the path you will use the options service of the software by typing in the command line: option + enter and 
then select the files tab followed by other activities that will be covered further in to this course. 
You can also access the options window by pressing the AutoCAD application button on the software + selecting the option 
icon at the lower right coroner of the resulting popup window.   
The default templates for example (1) .acad.dwt comes with settings such as:  the layer 0;  two layout tabs (without title blocks), 
two styles ,standards and annotative, for text, dimension and leaders, a standard style for table ; light color theme, white viewport 
background color, grid, , line types and blocks, etc.    
    

</p>



<p> You can create custom  line types hatches by making use of use of script files by creating 
      them with in AutoCAD in the visual lisp window and make them part of your custom template. You can create script files such as lisp files (.lsp), 
      line files (.lin) and pattern files (.pat) externally in notepad or other editors and integrate them back 
      to AutoCAD. Such script files can also be found online and users can download them according to their needs 
<a href="https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=featured&page=1" target="_blank">Free Autodesk for educational purposes ( https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=featured&page=1 )</a>. The latter ones will be covered in the latter subchapters of this AutoCAD package, 
professional application of AutoCAD.
However, the general understanding of the interface are covered in the following pages of this document as 
follows: 
</p>

<h3>A. The start window: <br> Study about the 12 indicated interface components of AutoCAD on the following image and related link. </h3>
<p>Mouse hovering on the image and clicking on it will take you to further interface study related to the descriptions on the image</p>

<div class="containerHover" style="background-color:white">
               <a href="interface00.html" target="_blank" ><img src="interface_images/start.png" alt="AutoCAD Interface basic" class="pics" width="100%"></a>
               <div class="middle">
                              <div class="text01">click on this image to further take a look at the interface information</div>
               </div>
</div>
<br>
<!-- <a href="interface01.html" target="_blank" > Please visit this page for further study on the first part of your basic interface AutoCAD  </a> -->
<h3>B. AutoCAD general Interface <br> 
      Study about the 18 indicated interface components of AutoCAD on the following image and related link. </h3>

You will find this interface once you opened a new project or an exiting project in AutoCAD.  There are generally 18 
important components of the interface you want to study. They are described in the next slides. 
You can also find these descriptions on the provided power point presentation <br><br>
<p>Mouse hovering on the image and clicking on it will take you to further interface study related to the descriptions on the image</p>
<div class="containerHover" style="background-color:white">
<a href="interface01.html" target="_blank" ><img src="flexbox/back.png" alt="AutoCAD Interface basic" class="pics" width="100%"></a>
<div class="middle">
               <div class="text01">click on this image to further take a look at the interface information</div>
</div>
</div> <br><br>

<p>At this point it is important to note the fact that in AutoCAD software there are also interface components that are  
               by default floating and  docked panels or can be made floating and docked according to the user’s preference. 
               These components include Properties panel, layer properties manager, etc. You can right click on any object
                you are drawing (creating) or editing and open the properties panel which you can implement as floating 
                (not attached to fixed components of the interface) or docked (attached to fixed interface components) 
                interface component.  This topic will be continue sly mentioned during your exercise activities. 
               </p>

               <p>
                     <p>
To further discuss about the matter over: <br>
with respect to what comes below the level of the tabs, it is important to understand that below tabs are ribbons  under them are panels containing specialized group 
of commands or tools that are placed horizontally arranged in a ribbon or every tab separated by an engraved line. 
The general level of hierarchy in accessing the commands or tools of AutoCAD are : Tabs + ribbons + panels + commands or tools 
(on recent interfaces). The older versions use the panel and tools bar system. Please take note of the fact that you  can mouse 
hover on any tools of the panels and access general information about each tool. Short key command and further information on how 
and what to use the commands for.    
Right clicking on each of the tools in a panel you will find an options such as (a) Show tabs and (b) show panels and (c). 
These options will allow you to hide or un hide any of the tabs and panels in your interface as per your interest. You can 
also add any of the panels in to the list of the quick access bar discussed above in the interface figures. How ever if you 
would right click in the ribbon with out clicking on the tools you will only find the first two options. Right clicking in the 
tab areas will yield different dropdown list from what you will get in the ribbon.   
Please also take note of the fact that you can get a docked or float windows when you for example right click on a drawing 
element in your model space such a properties manager panel. Or if you would click on the layer tool from its panel instead ,
 you will end up with the layer properties manager floating panel. Block editor windows are also floating windows.  The following 
 texts and images will explore the matter further partly.  </p>
   


 <p>

<h3>C. All tabs in AutoCAD</h3>

 <p> You will be seeing all tabs of the software where ever you may be in the interface 
       while working on AutoCAD </p>
<p>Mouse hovering on the image and clicking on it will take you to further interface study 
      related to the descriptions on the image</p>

 <h3>D. Panels of the home tab: <br> <br>
      Study about the 10 indicated interface components of 
      AutoCAD on the following image and related link. </h3>
<p>
     
 <p> You will find this interface once you clicked on the home tab. 
       You can also find these descriptions on the provided power point presentation  </p>

</div>
</div>

<br><br>


<h3>E. The Insert, Annotate, Parametric and Manage tab: <br> <br>
      Study about the indicated selected tabs and their related interface components on the following image and related link. 
Make sure to mouse hover and access further information about the tabs.
</h3>

<div class="containerHover" style="background-color:white">
      <a href="interface05.html" target="_blank" ><img src="moretabs/moretabsfront.png" alt="AutoCAD Interface basic" class="pics" width="100%"></a>
      <div class="middle">
                     <div class="text01">Click on this image to further take a look at the selected tabs' interface information</div>
      </div>
      </div>



   <h3>Understand that most commands must come together for the user to create a proper project. </h3>  
<p>
Only drawing lines and other objects without using the OSNAP modes ,ORTHOMODE/ POLAR mode applications 
from the control panel  would not yield a drawing that has precision. Similarly if a user applies the above 
modes and does not apply layers properly, would not create a project that is accessible for further modification 
(actually layers should be the first thing users should think about before starting to draw).   
Think that you need to coordinate among for example the draw panel (line, polyline, circle ,arc, polygon, etc. ), 
the modify panel (move, rotate, offset, etc.),  the annotate panel (text, dimension, leader, table, etc.), 
the control panel (ORTHO, POLAR, OSNAP, etc.) and the layer panel (layer properties, on/off, freeze, etc. ) 
should come together for your successful drawing activity. 
   </p> 
   <p>
Therefore, in AutoCAD simply (minimally) put , you organize (layer panel), you set up for precision (control panel), 
you create (draw panel, annotate panel, and the like), you modify (modify panel), you prepare for plot and presentation 
( layout tab) , you save (application icon/button or ctrl+s). 

   </p>


   
   <h3>F. The Control Panel <br> <br>
      Study about the indicated control panel interface components of 
      AutoCAD on the following image and related link. </h3>
      
<div class="containerHover" style="background-color:white">
      <a href="interface04.html" target="_blank" ><img src="controlpanel/controlpanel.png" alt="AutoCAD Interface basic" class="pics" width="100%"></a>
      <div class="middle">
                        <div class="text01">click on this image to further take a look at the control panel interface information</div>
      </div>
      </div>

<h3>G. The Layer properties manager  <br><br>
      Status, Name, Freeze, on/off, lock, 
      Plot, Color, Linetype, Lineweight, Transparency, New VP Freeze, Description,  Filters, etc.
        
</h3>
<p>   The standard AutoCAD software comes with. only two default layers and the user needs to carefully create needed layers 
      ad create standards for projects. <br> <br>The use of layers guarantees future modification and management of your project. Unless you have carefully created layers from the start, you will be faced with a lot of time cleaning up your document which is not a best practice in AutoCAD.
