<h2> 1.1.  Objective of the Course
</h2>
<p>To render the Youth Employment Project for Somalia (YEPS) project with introductory self-preparation
instruction materials and personal hands on practice on Computer aided design through the software
AutoCAD. The course addresses mid-level career engineers such as ( 1) Engineers working at the ministry
in charge of the public works and construction, (2) Engineers from private construction companies, and
(3) Professors of University professors. It encompasses the application of the software in various
professionals of the built environment, such us planning (Urban), construction and design (Architectural,
interior, sanitary and electrical and landscape). The course incorporates the application and pedagogy
of CAD specifically AutoCAD. </p>

<h2> 1.2.  Plan and strategy of the Introductory AutoCAD self-study and in person practice  
</h2>
<p>
There will be (1) introductory self-study section which is to be conducted remotely and to be addressed by studying a prepared 
lecture (PowerPoint and a video tutorial). This section shall have only one online question and answer session.   
(2) An in person practice of AutoCAD. During the in person practice that comes after the remote 
course addresses the students with hands on laboratory demonstrations, practices and assignments. 
Their final project with regards to preparation of documents should include the step by step creation of the 
building indicated schematically in 3D and 2D that is shown below (further technical measurement will be provided for 
the students at the time of project implementation. There should also be further 3D visualization of the project during the in 
person practice for the students so they can get further understanding of the project before they embark on creating the detailed 
2D documents of the project ):

</p>
<p>Students will basically be provided with schematic information about the project. As most details are to be interpreted by 
the students both individually and in groups, they shall come up with the final detailed 2D project accordingly. </p>

<h3>Important for final project: </h3>
Students have only short time to complete the project and the project is large for an individual task. Therefore, they need to work in 
groups by making use of the external reference (x-ref) functions of the AutoCAD software. This allows them to individually work on different
 parts of the project (a plan per person) by making use of the same standard of drawing such as layer naming, annotation styles, etc.  
For example in this particular group of students we have seven member and they can work on one person per plan (site plan: P1, G+0: P2, 
G+1:P3, G+2:P4, G+3:P5, G+4:P6, Roof plan:P7), and one person per sections and elevations, one person per details, etc. 
Such kind of individual and group work processes helps students to achieve to work in group and importantly to keep working with agreed 
up on standards of Cad documentations.     
</p>
<p>
In the spirit of the fact that students will be passing over their experience to others in the future, 
while participating on this course they should reflect on their experience while working on the chapter 
that deals with pedagogy of CAD.
</p>
<p>
Autodesk recognizes the advantages of third party developers and other contributes in such as researchers and students of the 
built environment. Such cases can be seen in the EiABC’s research named 
<a href="http://eiabc.edu.et/index.php/research/ethioplug-in-add-on-library">Ethioplugin (EP), </a> &nbsp 
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz-tUmMcmpNeUTBVbXhVYnpBOEE/view?usp=sharing"> Lecture</a> where Autodesk 
Revit architecture, AutoCAD and other software are used to document and transform Ethiopian local attributes and are 
made available for the built environment and the cad industry professionals’ community.
As such users of Community and Commercial CAD software should look in to the opportunity. Similarly this course 
shall constitute the active consideration of contribution in such regard through the process of teaching and learning.   
</p>
<p>In the notion that it is important to interpret and integrate the usage and implementation of the CAD industry products 
for education, design, planning and in general the development of the built environment to local cultures, 
skill and environments. 
</p>
<p>           
The course, covers topics such as: AutoCAD, Autodesk and the computer Aided Design industry, Introductory 
Discussion on AutoCAD and Preparation for Projects, Professional Application of AutoCAD and Pedagogy of CAD. 
The strategy of the course and the topics mentioned and how they are dealt with should be an indication for 
the students to consider it for their understanding while working on the demonstrations, exercises and assignments 
of this curse. This is to mean that the compilation, details and general topics covered and delivery of the course 
shall lend itself to the objective of the course partially. </p>

<h3>Important for class exercises and demonstrations: </h3>

<b>Individual students' background and interest, as architecture, urban planning and the like should be taken in to consideration while 
assigning class tasks and assignments.</b>
<p> 
Students shall work on demonstrations, exercises, assignments before they would work on their final project. 
These demonstrations, exercises and assignments should consider their individual student's background and interest, as architecture, 
urban planning, etc.
